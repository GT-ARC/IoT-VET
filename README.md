### IoT@VET Smart Factory Training Modules

The project IoT@VET ("Gamification-Based Teaching Materials for IoT Education in VET Schools" | www.iotvet.eu), supported by the EU Erasmus+ funding program, aims to develop digital teaching materials and a gamification-based platform for Internet of Things (IoT) education in vocational education and training (VET) schools.

This repository contains the practical exercise modules developed by GT-ARC in the scope of IoT@VET project, focusing on the smart factory use cases.

The modules were curated by Dr. Fikret Sivrikaya and co-implemented with students at TU Berlin / GT-ARC.

### Smart Factory Scenario and Training Module Index

10 training modules in the domain of factories are designed as an interconnected set of hands-on exercises. The individual modules can be developed by different students or student groups in a class to collectively realize a "smart factory" IoT scenario, as depicted in Figure 1.

In our scenario, there is a **warehouse**, where different parts are delivered and stored. These parts have specific temperature and humidity requirements for long-term storage. Therefore, sensors are deployed in the warehouse to monitor the environment.

The **production facilities** in the smart factory include conveyor belts and robotic systems for production. It is also supported by automated systems to pick up and deliver the required parts from the warehouses into the production facilities. For simplification, each product in our scenario is a combination of certain parts, as shown in Figure 1.

The **product stock** serves as a warehouse for finished products and facilitates their automated delivery based on sales orders. As in the parts warehouses, the product stock is also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to ensure proper storage conditions for the products.

Finally, the smart factory has an automated **inventory tracking system** to monitor the amount of available parts and products in real time. Whenever there is a new delivery of certain parts, the production of a product, or sales and delivery of a product, the inventories are updated accordingly.
